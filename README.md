# This is a WIP orb that will stop a job if it runs too long

Do you have jobs that are running away from you?
They typically run in 10 minutes, but sometimes they will inexplicably run for over an hour?
Are you tired of wasting credits or build minutes?

Well you're in luck! Now you can stop that job!

## Requirements

Include a user API key as a project environment variable named `STOP_THAT_JOB_ORB_TOKEN` first

## Examples

Check [the registry](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/fernfernfern/stopthatjob) for examples and info.
